### Comments and Reflections

This was my first time writing unit tests in R but I have written unit tests in java though. On a scale from 0 to 10, i found the logic of unit tests to be a 2 mainly because the different functions for determining equivalency were somewhat confusing at first confusing to understand. This was my first time working with ggvis so I found the syntax to be a 6 in terms of how confusing it was. This was also my first time working with conditional panels but it was significantly easier to understand so it was a 2. The graphing paradigm I liked the most was ggplot since I think it gives a nice balance of being able to plot more complex graphs and being reatively simple to implement. No one helped me complete this assignment and it took me about 24 hours to complete. the most tie consuming part was learning the ggvis syntax.
