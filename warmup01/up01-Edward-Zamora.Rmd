##Quadratic Equation
A [*quadratic equation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation) is any equation with form \(ax^2+bx+c=0\), where _x_ represents an unknown value and variables _a_, _b_, and _c_ are known coefficients.<br/>In a quadratic equation, values that satisfy _x_ can be found using the *quadratic formula* for roots:
  \[x=\frac{-b \pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \]
  
##Reflection  
The general markdown syntax was not that difficult to understand and was one of the easier parts of this task. However, the LaTex syntax for writing mathematical equations took more time as I had to look up much of the notation for the more complicated mathematical symbols. Overall, I feel this assignment helped reinforce markdown knowledge while I learned a lot about LaTex notation.
